     <h1> Steps to make Turkish Delight:</h1>

     <h2>1. Prepare the pan:</h2>
    <li> <strong> Prepare a metal 8x8-inch metal pan by greasing it with a neutral oil or cooking spray and lining it with baking parchment. Once lined, lightly oil or spray the lining and set the pan aside.</strong></li>

    <h2>2. Make the sugar syrup:</h2>
        <li> <strong> Place the sugar, lemon juice, zest, and 1 1/2 cups of water in a medium saucepan (at least 2-quart capacity) and stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Turn the heat to high, cover, and bring the mixture to a boil. Boil, covered, for 5 minutes to help dissolve any crystals clinging to the sides of the pot. Then uncover, place the candy thermometer in the saucepan, and let the mixture boil until it reaches a temperature between 240°F and 250°F (this could take anywhere from 7-10 minutes). The final sugar syrup will have a golden hue to it.</strong></li>

        <h2>3. Make the cornstarch paste:</h2>
<li> <strong> Whilst the sugar syrup is boiling, place the cornstarch, cream of tartar, and 2 cups of water in a deep, wide pot or saucepan (at least a 4-quart capacity) over medium heat and whisk until it forms a thick paste, about 3-5 minutes. Remove from the burner and set aside.</strong> </li>

        <h2>4. Combine the sugar syrup and cornstarch paste:</h2>
        <li> <strong>When the sugar syrup hits between 240°F and 250°F, remove the saucepan from heat.

            Place the pan with the cornstarch paste back on low heat and pour in the sugar syrup slowly and in small batches, whisking until it is fully incorporated and ensuring there are no lumps.   </strong></li>

        <h2>5. Cook the mixture gently for 1 hour:</h2>
        <li> <strong> Increase the heat to high until the combined mixture starts to bubble, then reduce heat to low and let the mixture gently bubble for approximately 1 hour, stirring every few minutes with a wooden spoon throughout this whole process. The mixture will go from a pale straw to a golden color. The markers for it being ready is that the mixture will leave the sides of the pan, can be pulled into the middle and is thick enough to see a clear line when you draw a spoon through it.</strong></li>

        <h2>6. Add flavor and color:</h2>
        <li> <strong>When the mixture is thick enough, add the vanilla essence, rose water, and food coloring of your choice. Stir until fully incorporated. Turn off the heat. </strong></li>

        <h2>7. Mold and set the Turkish delight: </h2>
<li> <strong> Swiftly pour the mixture into the lined dish. Using the back of a spoon, spread the mixture into all corners of the dish. Oil the spoon if the mixture sticks to the spoon.

    The mixture is still very hot at this point—don’t touch it!

    Leave uncovered somewhere dry to set overnight.</strong></li>

        <h2>8. Cut, finish, and store the Turkish delight:</h2>

        <li> <strong> Take a large bowl and sift 1/2 cup of powdered sugar and 1/4 cup of cornstarch into it. Sprinkle a little of the powder mixture on your work surface. Flip the Turkish delight onto the dusted work surface and peel off the parchment. Sprinkle more of the powder mixture onto the top of the Turkish delight slab.

            Take a pizza cutter and oil the blade with a little neutral oil and cut the Turkish delight into 6 equal strips. Then cut the strips into squares (6 per strip, totalling 36 squares) and toss in the bowl with the powder mixture.

            Once all squares have been cut and dusted, serve immediately or store in an airtight container in a cool and dry area. The Turkish delight is best enjoyed within 1 week.</strong></li>
